# CarsRace
- Console application created that can compare the performance of cars in race Using Factory Design Pattern and Dependancy Injection Pattern.

- Given a collection of vessels you should determine each vessels average consumption and which vessel that has the lowest consumption (fuel rate) on a given voyage. The voyage contains an arbitrary number of waypoints. When a vessel reaches a waypoint the captain can receive a speed instruction to use for the forthcoming leg (until the next waypoint). The instructions can be none, speed up by percentage, slow down by percentage or run at a certain speed. Each vessel has different performance specifications which defines its consumption at defined speed ranges. A vessel also has a max speed which it cannot go faster than.
   - Consumption is defined as a fuel rate -> tonnes/day(24h)
   - Speed is defined as m/s
